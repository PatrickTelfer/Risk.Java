# Risk.Java
This is a version of the board game Risk coded in Java featuring a custom made map made by Rob Nadal, Patrick Telfer and Stephen Robinson. Pictures can be found below.

### Some new features we added
 1. **Saving game:** at the start of any players deploying phase the game can be saved (stores the current game state into a txt file). This state can then be loaded up when the program is initially run by clicking the load game button.
 2. **Reinforcing:** After a player has attacked, they may choose two countries to send troops from one to the other (Providing the sending country has more than one troop).
